Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (Node Package Manager)

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Vishaldhakrey/NoteSpace
cd NoteSpace

1. **Dependencies Installation**: 
    - `npm install` in both the frontend and backend directories installs all the necessary libraries from `package.json`.

2. **Environment Configuration**: 
    - `.env` files are used to store sensitive data like MongoDB URIs and JWT secrets.
    - Make sure to replace `<Your MongoDB URI>`, `<Your Secret Key>`, and `<Your Cookie Name>` with actual values.

3. **Starting the Application**:
    - Backend: Run `npm run dev` to start the backend server.
    - Frontend: Run `npm start` to start the React development server.

This should help you set up and run your MERN application successfully.
